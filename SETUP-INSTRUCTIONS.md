# Mental Wellness App - Role-Based Authentication Setup

## Current Status ✅
Your authentication system has been successfully restructured with the following components:

### Completed Features:
- ✅ **Hybrid Authentication System**: Firebase (sessions) + Supabase (credentials)
- ✅ **Role-Based Login**: Single login supporting 3 user types
- ✅ **Clean Signin UI**: Demo credentials with no account creation
- ✅ **Dashboard Pages**: Created for all three user roles
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Complete SQL setup script ready

### User Roles & Access:
1. **Developer** (`developer@soulsync.com` / `dev123`)
   - Approves campus integration requests
   - Manages student access approvals
   - Dashboard: `/developer-dashboard`

2. **College Admin** (`admin@college.edu` / `welcome@123`)
   - Submits student access requests (max 10 students)
   - Tracks request status
   - Dashboard: `/admin-dashboard`

3. **Student** (`student@college.edu` / `welcome@123`)
   - Access mental wellness resources
   - Dashboard: `/student-dashboard`

## Next Steps to Complete Setup 🚀

### 1. Database Setup (5 minutes)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `database-setup.sql`
4. Click "Run" to create tables and demo data

### 2. Environment Configuration (2 minutes)
1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
2. Add your Supabase URL and anon key:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

### 3. Firebase Configuration (if not done)
1. Enable Email/Password authentication in Firebase Console
2. Ensure your Firebase config is in `.env.local`

### 4. Test the System 🎯
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/signin`
3. Test each user role with demo credentials
4. Verify dashboard routing works correctly

## Database Schema Overview 📊

### Tables Created:
- **`login_credentials`**: Stores user emails, passwords, and roles
- **`campus_requests`**: College integration requests from potential admins
- **`student_requests`**: Student access requests from college admins

### Demo Data Included:
- 1 Developer account (you)
- 1 College admin account
- 1 Student account
- Sample campus and student requests for testing

## Authentication Flow 🔐

1. **User enters credentials** → Signin page
2. **Supabase verification** → Check credentials table
3. **Firebase session creation** → Dummy user for session management
4. **Role-based routing** → Redirect to appropriate dashboard
5. **Dashboard access** → Role-specific functionality

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Common Issues:
1. **"Supabase client not configured"**: Check environment variables
2. **"signInWithEmail not a function"**: Ensure Firebase Email/Password is enabled
3. **Routing issues**: Verify dashboard pages exist and user roles match

### Testing Credentials:
```
Developer: developer@soulsync.com / dev123
Admin: admin@college.edu / welcome@123
Student: student@college.edu / welcome@123
```
