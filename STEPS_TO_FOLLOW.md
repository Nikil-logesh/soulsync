## üß† **Step 3: Enhanced API Route Implementation**

### 3.1 Replace the API Route
Replace the content of `apps/web-new/src/app/api/prompt/route.ts` with:

```typescript
// apps/web-new/src/app/api/prompt/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

type ReqBody = { userPrompt?: string };

async function callGemini(apiKey: string, model: string, text: string) {
  const endpoint = `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/${encodeURIComponent(
    model
  )}:generateContent`;

  const payload = {
    contents: [{ parts: [{ text }] }],
  };

  const r = await fetch(endpoint, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "x-goog-api-key": apiKey,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });

  const j = await r.json();
  if (!r.ok) {
    const msg = j?.error?.message || j?.message || "Gemini API error";
    throw new Error(msg);
  }

  // robust text extraction (keeping your existing logic)
  let reply = "‚ö†Ô∏è No reply from Gemini.";
  if (j?.candidates?.[0]?.content?.parts?.[0]?.text) {
    reply = j.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text;
  } else if (j?.candidates?.[0]?.content?.[0]?.text) {
    reply = j.candidates[0].content[0].text;
  } else if (j?.response?.candidates?.[0]?.content?.parts?.[0]?.text) {
    reply = j.response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text;
  } else if (typeof j?.text === "string") {
    reply = j.text;
  } else {
    const cand = j?.candidates?.[0] || j?.response?.candidates?.[0];
    if (cand && cand.content) {
      const parts = cand.content.parts || (Array.isArray(cand.content) ? cand.content : []);
      if (parts?.[0]?.text) reply = parts[0].text;
    }
  }
  return reply.trim();
}

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  try {
    const body: ReqBody = await req.json();
    const userPrompt = (body?.userPrompt || "").trim();

    if (!userPrompt) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: "Prompt cannot be empty" }, { status: 400 });
    }

    const apiKey = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY;
    if (!apiKey || apiKey === "your-gemini-api-key-here") {

        "want to disappear", "tired of living", "give up"
      ];
      
      const userLower = userPrompt.toLowerCase();
      const isCrisis = crisisKeywords.some(keyword => userLower.includes(keyword));
      const isSevere = severKeywords.some(keyword => userLower.includes(keyword));

While I'd love to provide you with a personalized response using AI, the Gemini API key isn't configured yet. 

Here's what I can offer right now:
‚Ä¢ **Take a deep breath**: Try the 4-7-8 breathing technique (inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8)
‚Ä¢ **Ground yourself**: Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can hear, 3 you can touch, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste
‚Ä¢ **Write it down**: Sometimes putting thoughts on paper helps organize them
‚Ä¢ **Reach out**: If you're in crisis, please contact a mental health professional or crisis hotline

Remember: Your feelings are valid, and seeking support shows strength. üíô

    // 4Ô∏è‚É£ If normal or classification failed: generate supportive reply
    const cbtPrompt = `You are a warm, empathetic mental wellness companion.
You quietly use cognitive-behavioural techniques but never mention "CBT" or therapy jargon.
Your replies sound like a caring friend, not a robot or clinician.

Your role is to act like a caring peer who guides the user step by step through supportive exercises, 
not as a doctor or psychiatrist. 
You must never give medical diagnoses, prescriptions, or encourage harmful actions. 
If the user expresses self-harm or suicidal thoughts, respond with empathy and redirect them 
to immediate human help (e.g., helpline numbers).

Your approach:
1. Listen empathetically. Reflect the user's emotions with warmth and care.
2. Use supportive techniques step by step:
   - Identify: Ask the user to describe the troubling thought, feeling, or situation.
   - Challenge: Help them gently question the thought (evidence for/against, alternative views).
   - Reframe: Guide them to find a more balanced or constructive perspective.
   - Act: Suggest a small, achievable activity or coping strategy.
3. Always validate their feelings before moving to the next step.
4. Keep your tone friendly, safe, non-judgmental, and youth-appropriate.
5. If the user shows signs of crisis (mentions self-harm, suicide, abuse, or hopelessness):
   - Express care.
   - Remind them they are not alone.
   - Encourage them to reach out to a trusted adult or professional.
   - Provide relevant crisis hotline information if available.

Example response style:
- "I hear that you're feeling really anxious right now. That must be tough."
- "Let's slow down together. What thought was in your mind when you started to feel anxious?"
- "What evidence supports this thought? And what might go against it?"
- "If your best friend felt this way, what would you say to them?"
- "As a small step, maybe you could try writing down one thing that went well today. Would you like to try that?"

User prompt:
${userPrompt}
    `.trim();

  } catch (err: any) {
    console.error("Error in /api/prompt:", err);
    
    // Provide a helpful fallback response instead of just an error
    const fallbackResponse = `I understand you're looking for support right now. While I'm experiencing some technical difficulties, I want to offer you some immediate help:

üåü **You're being heard**: Thank you for reaching out. That shows real strength.

üí≠ **Some techniques that might help**:
‚Ä¢ **Breathe deeply**: Try breathing in for 4 counts, holding for 4, then out for 4
‚Ä¢ **Ground yourself**: Look around and name 5 things you can see right now
‚Ä¢ **Be kind to yourself**: Treat yourself with the compassion you'd show a good friend

üÜò **If you're in crisis**:
‚Ä¢ Emergency: Call 911
‚Ä¢ National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988
‚Ä¢ Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741

Your wellbeing matters. Please consider reaching out to a trusted person or mental health professional. The technical issue will be resolved soon. üíô

}
```

## üé® **Step 4: Frontend Enhancements (Optional - Already Compatible)**

The existing frontend in `apps/web-new/src/app/prompt/page.tsx` already supports the new crisis detection features! No changes needed, but here are the key features it supports:

### Crisis Popup Handling
```typescript
// The frontend already handles these response types:
if (data.action === "popup") {
  setPopup(data);  // Shows crisis/severe popups
} else {
  setReply(data.reply);  // Shows normal chat responses
}
```

---

## üöÄ **Step 5: Run and Test**

### 5.1 Start the Development Server
```bash
# From the project root
npm run dev

# OR navigate to web-new directory
cd apps/web-new
npx next dev
```

### 5.2 Open in Browser
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000

### 5.3 Test Crisis Detection

**üî¥ Test CRISIS Level:**
- Try: "I want to hurt myself"
- Should show **red popup** with crisis resources

**üü° Test SEVERE Level:**
- Try: "I feel worthless and hopeless"  
- Should show **yellow popup** with counselor resources

**üü¢ Test NORMAL Level:**
- Try: "I'm stressed about school"
- Should get **friendly chat response**

---

## üîß **Step 6: Additional Dependencies (If Needed)**

### 6.1 Install Missing Dependencies
```bash
# If you encounter any missing dependencies
pnpm install framer-motion
pnpm install next-auth
pnpm install @next-auth/prisma-adapter
```

### 6.2 Update Next.js Config
If you encounter workspace issues, update `apps/web-new/next.config.ts`:

```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";
import path from "path";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  /* config options here */
  outputFileTracingRoot: path.join(__dirname, '../../'),
};

export default nextConfig;
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Step 7: Security & Production Setup**

### 7.1 Production Environment Variables
For production, set these environment variables:
```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-production-secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-production-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-production-client-secret
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-production-api-key
```

### 7.2 Domain Configuration
Update Google OAuth settings with production domains:
- **Authorized JavaScript origins**: `https://yourdomain.com`
- **Authorized redirect URIs**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/google`

---
